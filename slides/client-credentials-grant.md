## Client Credentials Grant

Client credential authorization is for the situations where the client application needs to access resources or call functions in the resource server, which are not related to a specific resource owner (e.g. user).

For instance, obtaining a list of venues from Foursquare.
This does not necessary have anything to do with a specific Foursquare user.
