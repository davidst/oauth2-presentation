## Refresh Token

Although not mandated by the spec, access tokens usually are short-lived and come with  an expiration time which can last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours.

Once an access token is expired, the client can request the authorization server to issue a new access token using the refresh token issued by the authorization server.
